 * \brief
 * Declares OpenMP wrappers to avoid conditional compilation.
 *
 * This module defines wrappers for OpenMP API functions and enables compiling
 * code without conditional compilation even when OpenMP is turned off in the
 * build system.
 * Therefore, OpenMP API functions should always be used through these wrappers
 * and omp.h should never be directly included.  Instead, this header should be
 * used whenever OpenMP API functions are needed.

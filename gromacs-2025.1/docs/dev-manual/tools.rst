Development-time tools
======================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   doxygen
   change-management
   infrastructure
   gmxtree
   code-formatting
   testutils
   physical_validation

.. todo:: :issue:`3032`

   here does not make much sense in the overall organization and creates a
   confusing TOC for the developer guide.

.. todo:: :issue:`3267`

   Add details for most of the tools, either in the form of links to wiki,
   or to a separate page that explains more details.
